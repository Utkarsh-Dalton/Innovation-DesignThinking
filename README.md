# Chemicals of Concern in Urban Food Systems

## Project Overview
This project investigates the presence of harmful chemicals in urban food chains, with a specific focus on packaged and processed foods. Using ethnographic research, data analysis, and design thinking, we developed innovative strategies to enhance food safety awareness and reduce chemical exposure. The project aims to bridge the gap between consumer awareness and regulatory measures, ensuring a healthier urban food ecosystem.

## Key Objectives
- **Identify Chemicals of Concern**: Research and document harmful chemicals found in packaged food products and their impact on health.
- **Analyze Consumer Behavior**: Understand how urban residents interact with processed foods, their awareness levels, and decision-making processes.
- **Develop a Digital Prototype**: Design an innovative solution that helps consumers make informed food choices.
- **Propose Policy Recommendations**: Provide data-driven insights for regulatory bodies to strengthen food safety norms.

## Methodology
### 1. **Requirement Gathering & Research**
- Conducted **10+ stakeholder interviews** with urban residents, food industry professionals, and regulatory authorities.
- Surveyed **100+ individuals** on their packaged food consumption habits and awareness of harmful food additives.
- Applied **ethnographic research techniques** such as participant observation and structured questionnaires to derive qualitative insights.

### 2. **Data Analysis & Modeling**
- Collected and processed survey data to map dietary habits and exposure to chemicals.
- Applied **clustering techniques** to segment consumer behavior patterns based on food consumption preferences.
- Identified key **chemicals of concern** such as artificial sweeteners, trans fats, and preservatives.
- Generated **3+ policy recommendations** aimed at reducing chemical exposure in the food supply chain.

### 3. **Prototype Development**
- Designed an **interactive Figma prototype** of an organic food tracking app.
- Integrated **QR-based food tracking**, allowing users to scan food items and get real-time ingredient breakdowns.
- Developed **5+ UI/UX screens** focused on user engagement, transparency, and accessibility.
- Ensured that the app provided **personalized recommendations** based on user dietary preferences and restrictions.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Increased Public Awareness** â€“ Educate urban consumers on food safety and the risks of chemicals in processed foods.
- **Data-Driven Policy Insights** â€“ Enable policymakers to strengthen food safety regulations using concrete data and findings.
- **Improved Consumer Behavior** â€“ Influence individuals to adopt healthier food choices through enhanced awareness and digital solutions.
- **Technological Innovation** â€“ Develop a user-friendly prototype that bridges the gap between information accessibility and decision-making.

## Success Metrics
- **Reduction in Chemical Exposure Risks** â€“ Measured through user adoption of the QR-tracking feature in the prototype app.
- **Increase in Consumer Awareness** â€“ Tracked via survey comparisons before and after awareness campaigns.
- **Regulatory Adoption** â€“ Engagement from policymakers and food safety authorities based on policy recommendations.
- **Prototype Engagement** â€“ User interactions with the Figma prototype and feedback on usability.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Figma** â€“ For UI/UX design and prototyping of the food tracking app.
- **Excel/Python** â€“ For data analysis, segmentation, and clustering techniques.
- **Google Forms & Survey Tools** â€“ For conducting consumer awareness research and stakeholder interviews.
- **MURAL** â€“ Used for brainstorming sessions, mind mapping, and cluster formation to identify key problem areas and solutions.

## Challenges Faced
- **Regulatory Hurdles** â€“ Difficulty in acquiring industry-level data on food chemical composition.
- **Data Collection Barriers** â€“ Limited access to consumer purchase behavior and dietary habits.
- **Behavioral Resistance** â€“ Encouraging consumers to adopt healthier habits despite convenience-driven choices.
- **Time Constraints** â€“ Managing project deliverables within the given timeframe while ensuring high-quality research and analysis.
